So you think you want a bunny.
Bunnies are cute, lovable little animals that many of us have come to know under names like Peter Cotton Tail, Bugs Bunny, Thumper, the Uncle Remus Folk Tale of Brer Rabbit, and yes, even the Easter Bunny.  And so we apply all kinds of behavioral characteristics to bunnies, some that are well earned and others that are purely imaginary.
Before you dive into owning a bunny it is important to separate fact from fiction and make sure that the cute, loveable furry little animal you are thinking of buying is truly the individual you have pictured in your mind.  The best way to go about doing this is to do a little reading before buying.  Your bunny is a living, breathing and very unique individual possessing a personality all of its own.  An individual you will need to be introduced to and learn to know on his terms and not your own.  You may notice that I often use the masculine personal pronoun “HE” when referring to your rabbit or bunny.  Why?  Well, for starters, I am not a political correctness freak and I do not believe in neutering the English language.  I am also just more comfortable using the masculine reference, so please just accept it.  I have nothing against women, so let’s not even go there.
